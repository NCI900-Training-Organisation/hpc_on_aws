# Ansible Configuration File
# Purpose: Disable SSH host key checking for automated environments
# Author: [Your Name]
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# This configuration is useful for dynamic infrastructure setups,
# such as AWS EC2 instances launched with Terraform, where host keys
# are not known in advance and SSH prompts would block automation.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

[defaults]
# Disable host key checking in Ansible
# This prevents Ansible from prompting:
# "The authenticity of host can't be established..."
# Useful for CI/CD or ephemeral instances where manual confirmation
# is not possible or desirable.
host_key_checking = False

[ssh_connection]
# Disable strict SSH host key checking at the SSH layer
# -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no  : Accept unknown host keys automatically
# -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null : Prevent storing host keys in ~/.ssh/known_hosts
# This ensures clean, promptless SSH connections.
ssh_args = -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
